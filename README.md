# How to use this Docker image

This Docker image is intended to be used in conjunction with a Docker container orchestration service such as
-   Kubernetes (see [Jenkins Kubernetes Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin))
-   Mesos (see [Jenkins Mesos Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Mesos+Plugin))
-   Amazon EC2 Container Service

It can also be used "static" Jenkins slave connected to a Jenkins master declaring a JNLP slave but it would require to manually launch the Docker container.

# Running

To run a Docker container

    docker run cloudbees/jnlp-slave-with-java-build-tools -url http://jenkins-server:port <secret> <slave name>

optional environment variables:

* `JENKINS_URL`: url for the Jenkins server, can be used as a replacement to `-url` option, or to set alternate jenkins URL
* `JENKINS_TUNNEL`: (`HOST:PORT`) connect to this slave host and port instead of Jenkins server, assuming this one do route TCP traffic to Jenkins master. Useful when when Jenkins runs behind a load balancer, reverse proxy, etc.
